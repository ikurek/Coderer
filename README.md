## What's working and wht's not
Current version (2.0.1) is fully functional for any Ghost installation below version 3.0.0. I'm currently working for updating this project for latest Ghost release. So far, it's missing given classes:
* .kg-gallery-container
* .kg-gallery-row
* .kg-gallery-image
* .kg-bookmark-card
* .kg-bookmark-container
* .kg-bookmark-content
* .kg-bookmark-title
* .kg-bookmark-description
* .kg-bookmark-metadata
* .kg-bookmark-icon
* .kg-bookmark-author
* .kg-bookmark-publisher
* .kg-bookmark-thumbnail
Everything except `bookmarks` and `gallery` screens is fully themed.
